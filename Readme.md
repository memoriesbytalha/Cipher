# Caesar Cipher

This is a simple Python program that performs the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption on a given text message.

## How to Use

1. Run the script using Python: `python caesar_cipher.py`.
2. Choose whether you want to Encrypt or Decrypt the message.
3. Enter your message.
4. Enter the shift value you want to apply to the message.
5. The program will display the result of the encryption or decryption.

## Implementation Details

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher that replaces each letter in the plaintext with a letter at a fixed shift in the alphabet. The program uses a list of the lowercase letters of the alphabet for the substitution.
